There seems to be a variety of Homebridge plugins for eWeLink/Sonoff devices. My aim for this package is to bring together the best from all the different ones. I am constantly tinkering with the code, please feel free to post issues or pull requests.

This project was forked and based on the work of [homebridge-ewelink-max](https://github.com/howanghk/homebridge-ewelink).

Thanks :)
